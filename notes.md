overall structure:
 - declare functions and classes in the .h file
 - in subordinate files, fill in definitions
 - subordinate files
    - main.cpp - overall structure for the program
    - setup.cpp - get mesh data and initialize with flow
    - solver.cpp - body of the solver

 questions:
 - what links the files
 - modularization
 - structures: equivalent of tuple? has to be declared ahead of time?
